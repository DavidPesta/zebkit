**Zebkit API doc is still under construction and not completely relevant to the latest zebkit code base. The documentation is available by the link below:** 

Zebkit API doc has been build basing on special zebkit "yuidoc" theme. The theme has been developed to present classes, interfaces, API methods with a candy look and feel and improved navigation:

<a href="{{site.apidocBase}}/{{site.themeId}}/index.html"> 
![ScreenShot]( {{ site.baseurl }}public/images/api-{{site.themeId}}.png?200x200)
</a>

The "yuidoc" theme is reusable for any other JS project that needs it. Find the project on github following the link below:
